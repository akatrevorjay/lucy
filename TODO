### State Plugin
Move the $lucy->{state} into the db. Way too much information is duplicated imo, and
 I would like to reduce that.
Update the code to whats in PoCo::IRC::State again. They've been busy, and I have been lazy.
# DB Psuedo-format
lucy_state_users = {
	id => 0,
	nick => 'trevorj',
	
}

### User info in subs
# - There is a problem with the way the information is handled to the events imo.
We should keep track of the users, channels; see above; and hand a user hash to the events.
What about a user object?? That would be sweet, we could have helper functions for grabbing the full mask, etc
$user = {
	nick		=> 'lamer',
	username	=> 'evilllama',
	host		=> 'goatse.cx',
	
	ircname		=> 'Muahaaha',
};

### NickTrakar plugin
#	- track nick changes, have an aliases column? IMPORTANTE!!!! MUCHOS!
