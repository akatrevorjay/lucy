	  PoCo::IRC::State again, as I don't want to recreate the wheel
	  unless it's needed.
	  Sky, RSS, Alice, Logger, State, ChuckNorris: Priority fixes.
	  Also, priorities are exported a different way, aka not through an
	  ugly function.
	  ATTENTION: Whenever an event is considered handled, ie, sending
	  the event to other diamonds would only waste efficiency, return a
	  value of 1 and it will stop parsing the event. This is needed for
	  catch-all Diamonds like Alice.
